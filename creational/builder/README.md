## Builder Design Pattern

[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)

Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used for constructing complex objects. Below is the UML diagram.

### UML Diagram

### Mapping (Also Refer 5th point â€“ Example)

| UML | Example|
| - | - |
| Director | director.go |
| Builder Interface | iBuilder.go |
| Concrete Builder 1 | normalBuilder.go |
| Concrete Builder 2 | iglooBuilder.go |
| Product | house.go |

### When To Use

- Use Builder pattern when the object constructed is big and requires multiple steps. It helps in less size of the constructor.  The construction of the house becomes simple and it does not require a large constructor

- When a different version of the same product needs to be created. For example, in the below code we see a different version of house ie. igloo and the normal house being constructed by **iglooBuilder** and **normalBuilder**

- When half constructed final object should not exist. Again referring to below code the house created will either be created fully or not created at all. The Concrete Builder struct holds the temporary state of house object being created
